The purpose of this ctestis task is to correct signal levels of point-like
sources in photometry tables measured from STIS CCD images for charge loss
due to imperfect Charge Transfer Efficiency (CTE). The algorithm used to
correct for CTE-induced signal loss is based on the equations published in 
Goudfrooij, Bohlin, Maiz-Apellaniz, & Kimble, PASP, October 2006 edition
(astro-ph/0608349). The values of CTE loss derived using this algorithm
should be accurate to about 3% RMS (tested for data taken between March
1997 and August 2004). No significant differences in CTE loss were found
for different aperture sizes, although this has been verified only for a
limited range of aperture sizes (2, 3, and 5 pixel radii). The algorithm
was derived from measurements of point sources in a relatively sparse
field (the outskirts of a Galactic globular cluster), as detailed in the
PASP paper mentioned above.

The function also computes the shift in the Y centroid of point sources
due to distortions in the steller PDF cause by CTE trails. the algorithm
is taken from the Equation 9 of Goodfrooij et al. (2006). Note, however,
that the equation has been multiplied by -1, so that the resulting
correction may be ADDED to measured Y centriod of each star.

The code takes inputs of net counts for a source (background subtracted), a
sky-background estimate, and the source Y-position on the detector (since
CTI effects worsen furthest from the readout). The single-pixel
sky-background estimate should be measured from individual cosmic-ray (CR)
split, bias- and dark-subtracted, and flat-fielded images (flt.fits) that
have not had any sky subtracted. This can determined with random sampling
and/or iterative sigma-clipping of sky pixels (e.g., Goudfrooij et al.
2006). The net counts measured from the science images (summed, sky-
subtracted exposures) should then be scaled to the exposure time of the CR
split FLT image (e.g., if CRSPLIT=5, the net counts are divided by five).
Note that not all extensions composing an FLT file necessarily have equal
exposure times, so a fractional scaling of the CR split to total exposure
time of the CR-combined science image (e.g. CRJ) science image should be
used to scale the counts. The magnitude correction (dmagc) measured using
single-CR split parameters can be added to the magnitude derived from the
total exposure time science image with no further scaling.

If working with CRSPLIT scaled sky and net counts values, the filename 
(stisimage) should not be provided to avoid pulling incorrect information 
from the image headers. The following parameters therefore should be set 
manually: nread=1 (indicating it is just one CRSPLIT exposures), gain, 
mjd (start date), and ybin (BINAXIS2). If image is an sx2.fits file, set 
sx2=True.

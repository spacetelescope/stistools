    like fit1d, response, etc.  The default behaviour is to fit a cubic spline with order 3
    (3 equal regions, 2 knots) with no sigma clipping.

    Parameters
    ----------

    x : 1-d ndarray
        The array of independent values

    y : 1-d ndarray
        The array of dependent values.  Must have same length as x, or function returns None

    weights : 1-d ndarray or None
        The array of weights.  If set to None, the points are given equal weight of 1.0.  If not
        set to None, must have the same length as x and y, or the function returns None

    naverage : int
        The number of adjacent elements of x, y, and weight that are averaged before
        fitting is done.  If naverage=1, no averaging is done.

    function : str
        Fitting function.  Currently only "spline1" and "spline3" are supported

    order : int
        Order of fitting fuction.  The number of knots in the spline fit is (order-1)

    low_reject : float
        Points with y values less than fit - low_reject*(rms deviation of data from fit) are rejected
        when the fit is iterated.  Ignored if niterate = 0.

    high_reject : float
        Points with y values greater than fit + low_reject*(rms deviation of data from fit) are rejected
        when the fit is iterated.  Ignored if niterate = 0.

    niterate : int
        Number of times sigma-clipping iterations are performed.  niterate=0 corresponds to no
        sigma clipping

    grow : float
        Used to calculate how many elements adjacent to reject pixels are also rejected.
        Not currently implemented, but included to duplicate the IRAF fitting parameter.

    Returns
    -------

    fit : scipy.interpolate.fitpack2.LSQUnivariateSpline object
        The result of the fit.  It can be used to calculate the fitted
        values for the input x values:
